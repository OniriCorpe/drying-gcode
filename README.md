# drying-gcode

some handcrafted gcode files for drying filament using the heated bed

I'm using the temperature and waiting time [recommended by Prusa](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/drying-filament_332086#drying-methods)

## usage

- read [the licence](https://github.com/OniriCorpe/drying-gcode/blob/main/LICENCE.md)
- place the filament spool and a cardboard box on the heating bed
- launch the gcode corresponding to the plastic type

## why?

buying specialized equipment just for occasional use is totally dispensable  
when you have hardware capable of doing something, there is no need to buy another thing to do the exact same thing  
capitalism tends to make us believe the opposite
